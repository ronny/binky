# Binky

Binky is an HTML5 editor.

It's a work in progress, it doesn't do anything useful yet at the moment.

## Goals

- Valid and semantic HTML5
- No inline styling
- Extensible
- Fully stylable with CSS
- Gracefully degradable
- Easy to use
- Very minimal dependencies

## Installing

See `docs/README.md` for more info.
